## Features  

- Perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
- A clean and intuitive interface designed for ease of use.  
- Error handling to manage invalid inputs or empty strings gracefully.  
- Displays results formatted to two decimal places for better readability.

## Technical Features  

1. *Java Swing*:  
   Utilized for creating the desktop application's graphical interface.  

2. *Event-Driven Programming*:  
   Responds to user interactions like button clicks through event handling mechanisms.  

3. *Action Listeners*:  
   Implemented to detect user actions and trigger corresponding logic.  

4. *GUI Components*:  
   Includes buttons, labels, text fields, and other elements to build the calculator's interface.  

5. *Layout Management*:  
   Ensures components are arranged in a logical and visually appealing way using layout managers.  

6. *Java AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit)*:  
   Used for window creation, event handling, and graphics operations.  

7. *Nimbus Look and Feel*:  
   Applied to provide a consistent and modern appearance across platforms.  

8. *Multi-Threading*:  
   GUI-related code is executed on the *Event Dispatch Thread (EDT)* using java.awt.EventQueue.invokeLater().  

9. *String Formatting*:  
   Formats calculation results to display a maximum of two decimal places.  

10. *Error Handling*:  
    Basic error handling is included to check for invalid inputs or empty strings before performing calculations.
